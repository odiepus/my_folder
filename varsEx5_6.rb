puts %Q(Variable Exercise 5
      Case 1:
      x = 3)
puts %Q(Case 2:
      x is in an inner block. Thus, we do not have access to it from the outer block.
      We would then get an error if we tried to run the code.
      y is accessible from outer block and is equal to 3.)

#Exercise 6
puts %Q(Variable Exercise 6
      'shoes' is called on line 3 in irb console. Either 'shoes'
      was never initialized or it is in another block of code.)
